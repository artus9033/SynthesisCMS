| Boron Extension Global Laravel App Routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| All the global (laravel app) routes related to the Boron extension have to go in here.
| These routes are interpreted from the root of app url, e.g. defining a route as
| Route::get('/extension' [...]) will listen at host:port/extension
| If you want to add relative routes, use SynthesisCMS API
| Add relative routes to ExtensionKernel.php using the SynthesisCMS\API\SynthesisRouter class.
